Hi, I'm Witek! ChatGPT said that I am a mix of coder, storyteller and maths enthusiast constantly refining both my technical skills and my worldview.
Well, who am I to argue with AI ‚ò∫Ô∏è

But in all honesty, I do enjoy learning new things in the worlds of math and computer science. I love writing code, and I‚Äôm a little afraid I might be *slightly* addicted to [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com) IDEs.
I enjoy solving problems ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs through writing efficient algorithms, optimizing systems, or just making something work better than before. 
When I‚Äôm not coding, I‚Äôm probably reading about AI, working on a writing project, or hanging out with friends‚Ä¶ so I don‚Äôt end up talking to my computer screen. üòÖ

Always open to interesting discussions, collaborations, and learning from others!

## Master's Degree
Artificial Inteligence major at Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology ([PWR](https://pwr.edu.pl)) (2023-2024).  
**Master's Thesis:** *Grammatical embedding of texts and its applications in clusterization, visualization and classification of texts in Polish*
<details>

<summary>Abstract</summary>
The work investigates the effectiveness of grammatical embeddings of texts (grembeddings)
in the tasks of clustering, classification, and visualization of texts in Polish. Grembeddings,
unlike semantic vectorization, represent texts based on their grammatical structure, capturing
syntactic and morphological features. The study explores the application of grembeddings in
combination with various traditional and deep learning-based vectorization techniques, 
including Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF, and variants of BERT. The research utilizes seven diverse Polish
datasets, encompassing literary texts, newspaper articles, social media posts, and fanfiction
stories, with varying levels of semantic similarity and authorial styles. The experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of grembeddings in author identification tasks, especially for
texts with similar semantics but different writing styles. In tasks requiring thematic analysis,
semantic embeddings outperformed grembeddings, highlighting the importance of semantic
information in clustering and classification. The results suggest that grembeddings are a
valuable complement to traditional text representation methods, particularly in capturing
stylistic nuances and enhancing author attribution.
