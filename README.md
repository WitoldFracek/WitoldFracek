Hi, I'm Witek! ChatGPT said that I am a mix of coder, storyteller and maths enthusiast constantly refining both my technical skills and my worldview.
Well, who am I to argue with AI ☺️

But in all honesty, I do enjoy learning new things in the worlds of math and computer science. I love writing code, and I’m a little afraid I might be *slightly* addicted to [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com) IDEs.
I enjoy solving problems — whether it’s through writing efficient algorithms, optimizing systems, or just making something work better than before. 
When I’m not coding, I’m probably reading about AI, working on a writing project, or hanging out with friends… so I don’t end up talking to my computer screen. 😅

Always open to interesting discussions, collaborations, and learning from others!
