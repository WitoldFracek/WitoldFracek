Hi, I'm Witek! ChatGPT said that I am a mix of coder, storyteller and maths enthusiast constantly refining both my technical skills and my worldview.
Well, who am I to argue with AI ‚ò∫Ô∏è

But in all honesty, I do enjoy learning new things in the worlds of math and computer science. I love writing code, and I‚Äôm a little afraid I might be *slightly* addicted to [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com) IDEs.
I enjoy solving problems ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs through writing efficient algorithms, optimizing systems, or just making something work better than before. 
When I‚Äôm not coding, I‚Äôm probably reading about AI, working on a writing project, or hanging out with friends‚Ä¶ so I don‚Äôt end up talking to my computer screen. üòÖ

Always open to interesting discussions, collaborations, and learning from others!
